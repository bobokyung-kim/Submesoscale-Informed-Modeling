# Submesoscale-Informed-Modeling

This repository contains the neural network architecture and workflow associated with a manuscript submitted to the Journal of Advances in Modeling Earth Systems.

## Demo mode
The notebooks run in DEMO_MODE=True so they can execute without the original datasets. Dummy tensors are used to demonstrate the model architecture and inference workflow.

## Data availability
The original ocean simulation outputs are too large to distribute publicly and are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request.
