This repository provides the neural network architecture and workflow used in the manuscript:

Kim & Hwang (2026), Journal of Advances in Modeling Earth Systems

## Demo mode
The notebooks run in DEMO_MODE=True so they can execute without the original datasets.
Dummy tensors are used to demonstrate the model architecture and inference workflow.

## Data availability
The original ocean simulation outputs are too large to distribute publicly and are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request.
