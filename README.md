## What is included
- Model architecture
- Preprocessing pipeline
- Inference example

## What is NOT included
Training data and high-resolution ocean simulation outputs are not distributed due to their large size but are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request.

## Example
Run a dummy inference:
